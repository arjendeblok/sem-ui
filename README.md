# sem-ui

Sem-ui is a framework to create semantic HTML web pages. 
That means you do not need any sem-ui related CSS classes in your HTML.
You can pick and choose which part of the framework you want in your project. 

It consists of only SASS mixins, so it will not create any CSS for you, 
but you have to include these powerfull mixins in your own (sematic) CSS classes.
